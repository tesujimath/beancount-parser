# beancount-parser-lima

A zero-copy parser for Beancount in Rust.

It is intended to be a complete implementation of the Beancount file format, except for those parts which are deprecated and other features as documented here (in a list which may not be comprehensive).

Currently under active development.  APIs are subject to change, but I hope not majorly.

The slightly strange name is because of a somewhat careless failure on my part to notice the existing [beancount-parser](https://github.com/jcornaz/beancount-parser) when starting this project, for which apologies.

## Features

- fast, thanks to [Logos](https://docs.rs/logos/latest/logos/) and [Chumsky](https://docs.rs/chumsky/latest/chumsky/) zero copy

- beautiful error messages, thanks to [Ariadne](https://docs.rs/ariadne/latest/ariadne/)

- interface for applications to also report beautiful errors in their original context, as in the example below

- focus on conceptual clarity of application domain objects mapped to Rust types

- [Python bindings](/beancount-parser-lima-python/README.md) (work-in-progress)

## Roadmap

- create Python bindings, so that this could be a drop-in replacement for the existing Beancount parser (which is not to say it will necessarily become that!)

- improve API in the light of experience, i.e. when it gets some use ðŸ˜…

- address mistakes, misunderstandings, and edge-cases in the initial implementation as they are discovered

## Uncertainties / TODOs

Yeah, Beancount is complicated, and I may have made some mistakes here.  Current list of uncertainties, which is certainly not comprehensive.

- metadata tags/links for a directive get folded in with those in the directive header line

## Unsupported

This is an incomplete list of what is currently unsupported.

- custom directive
- plugins

### Unsupported Options

- `allow_pipe_separator`
- `allow_deprecated_none_for_tags_and_links`
- `default_tolerance`
- `experiment_explicit_tolerances`
- `insert_pythonpath`
- `plugin`
- `plugin_processing_mode`
- `tolerance`
- `use_legacy_fixed_tolerances`

Also, unary options are not supported.

## Alpha Status Dependencies

- Chumsky `1.0.0.alpha.*` releases are required for zero-copy support

- smallvec `2.0.0-alpha.*` releases are required for correct lifetime inference

## Alternatives

[beancount-parser](https://github.com/jcornaz/beancount-parser) is another parser for Beancount which predates this one,
using [nom](https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/) instead of [Chumsky](https://docs.rs/chumsky/latest/chumsky/).
